### 🧠 Overview

### 🌐 Web Application Basics  
- Learned how web browsers and servers communicate using HTTP, including how requests and responses are structured with methods, codes, and headers.  
- Gained a strong understanding of how URLs, front-end and back-end systems, and security headers play a role in how web applications function.

### 🧩 JavaScript Essentials  
- Learned how JavaScript powers interactive websites through variables, functions, loops, and browser dialogue methods.  
- Explored how attackers abuse poorly written JS for login bypasses or XSS, and practised secure coding techniques like separating logic and avoiding client-side trust.

### 🧮 SQL Fundamentals  
- Explored how to interact with relational databases using SQL commands like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.  
- Learned how to filter, sort, and aggregate data using clauses, operators, and built-in functions to support cyber security tasks.

### 🧪 Burp Suite: The Basics  
- Learned how to set up Burp Suite, intercept traffic with the Proxy, and test HTTP requests using tools like Repeater and Decoder.  
- Explored the interface, used FoxyProxy to route browser traffic, and successfully executed a reflected XSS payload.

### ⚠️ OWASP Top 10 - 2021  
- Explored the most critical web application vulnerabilities as defined by OWASP, including Injection, Broken Access Control, and Security Misconfigurations.  
- Practised exploiting real examples to understand each weakness, and learned how poor design or outdated components can lead to major security risks.
